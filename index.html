                <p>Project Aegis was a Virtual Reality project done for the Singapore Armed Forces for my 
                    Final Year Project in Singapore Polytechnic. The size of the team was 10 people, double
                    the average size of an average FYP team. I undertook the role of one of the two programming leads,
                    and helped plan the technical aspects of the project and helped streamline the programming workflow
                    by enforcing a scrum board and introducing a pub-sub code design system.

                    Personally, I took up tasks such as programming a gun system that allows realistic replication of guns,
                    including a safety and cocking mechanism. Unfortunately, I am unable to share much about this project as
                    our client has requested for us not to disclose too much about the project.

                    Estella was a Single Player Role Playing Game made for a School Project in my second year of education in Singapore Polytechnic.
                    The player plays as a Estella, a mage who has mastery of 5 elements, fire, water, wind, earth and lightning, and can combine the elements
                    through numerous interactions to unleash powerfull combinations on her foes. Estella's hometown is attacked by Skylark, a ruthless
                    dictator seeking to take over the world. Estella ventures accross the world to seek revenge on her hometown and to save the world
                    from evil skylark </p>

                    I worked on the level design of the game for 2 levels, Estella's hometown and the dessert city. Through this project
                    I learnt many terraining techniques and researched into level design principals. I drew inspiration from masterpieces
                    such as Breath Of The Wild and Guild Wars 2 for my colour pallette and overall aesthetic. I also designed the user interface
                    and created a dialog and questing system that guides the players through the game and its story. I also designed and programmed
                    the second boss fight, the ghost of an ancient priest who uses magic pillars to crush the player.
